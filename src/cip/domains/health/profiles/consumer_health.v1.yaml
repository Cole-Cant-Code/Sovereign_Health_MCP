  Personal health domain profile for the CIP Health data bank.
  Four layers map consumer health signals: physiological stability,
  metabolic balance, activity/recovery patterns, and preventive care
  engagement. Weights encode consumer health theory where metabolic
  balance (0.30) is the most structural long-term predictor.

  - vital_stability
  - metabolic_balance
